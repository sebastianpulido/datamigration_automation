    // Value Range and Constraint Validation
    // Validate that numeric values fall within acceptable ranges

    // Constraint Checks: Ensure values conform to specific constraints, such as dates not being in the future

    // Format Validation
    // Data Format: Check that values follow expected formats. For example, email addresses should have a valid format

    // Null Value Validation
    // Required Fields: Ensure that mandatory fields are not null. For instance, a "customer ID" should never be null if it’s a required field

    // Verify that optional fields are handled consistently

    // Uniqueness Validation
    // Primary Key Uniqueness: Ensure that fields designated as primary keys are unique across rows. For instance, each "order ID" should be unique.

    // Validate any other fields that should have unique values, such as "username" or "email address".

    // Referential Integrity
    // Foreign Key Validation: Ensure that foreign key references are valid and exist in the related tables. For example, if a record in the "orders" table refers to a "customer ID" in the "customers" table, that "customer ID" should exist in the "customers" table.

    // Business Rule Validation
    // Domain-Specific Rules: Apply business rules relevant to the data. For instance, an "order" should not have a "shipped date" that precedes the "order date".
    // Consistency Checks: Validate that business logic is consistently applied, such as ensuring that "start date" is always before "end date"

    // Duplication Checks
    // Duplicate Records: Identify and handle duplicate rows based on key fields or a combination of fields that should be unique.

    // Data Completeness
    // Field Completeness: Ensure all expected fields are present and contain meaningful data. For example, each "transaction" should have a "transaction amount".

    // Data Consistency
    // Cross-Field Consistency: Check that related fields are consistent with each other. For instance, if an "age" field is present, it should be consistent with a "date of birth" field.

    // Default Value Validation
    // Default Values: Validate that default values are applied correctly when expected. For example, a field that defaults to a certain value should not be left blank.
